# DHARMASEED.ORG
# Probably the biggest resource of dharma talks on the net.
# We make use of the fact that Dharmaseed paginates all its talks on a consistent URL.
# Dharmaseed also has a rich archive of teachers; with bios, pics and website links, these
# pages are kept on seperate pages which we can easily parse

# Nokgiri's at_css method is the same as css() (and jQuery's $), except it pops off the first element.
# Also note tolerant_css() that is more forgiving _and_ returns the matched element's contents
# by default.

# May all beings be from suffering
